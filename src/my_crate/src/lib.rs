//! # My Crate
//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain
//! calculations more convenient.

/// Adds one to the number given.
// --snip--

/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let arg = 5;
/// let answer = my_crate::add_one(arg);
///
/// assert_eq!(6, answer);
/// ```
///
/// # Panics
/// The scenarios in which the function being documented could panic. Callers of the function who
/// don’t want their programs to panic should make sure they don’t call the function in these
/// situations.
///
///# Errors
/// If the function returns a Result, describing the kinds of errors that might occur and what
/// conditions might cause those errors to be returned can be helpful to callers so they can write
/// code to handle the different kinds of errors in different ways.
///
/// # Safety
/// If the function is unsafe to call (we discuss unsafety in Chapter 19), there should be a section
/// explaining why the function is unsafe and covering the invariants that the function expects
/// callers to uphold.
